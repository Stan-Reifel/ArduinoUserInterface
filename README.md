# Arduino User Interface

This library is a simple user interface for building Arduino applications.  Adding menus to your sketch is as-easy-as filling in a table.  The library requires a Nokia 5110 LCD display and four push buttons (Up, Down, Select & Back).  The library also includes many functions for displaying your own data.
